## Thank you

First and formost, thank you for being interested in contributing to the list. As it keeps expanding, its usability and popularity will grow as well!

## Adding

An application may be added when a direct download link exists to the latest version of said program. The application must be currently maintained, safe to use and legal to download without any form of payment. It should also support the currently most common operating systems, such as Windows, macOS or GNU/Linux. Note that only application that support the English-language are currently allowed (e.g. English (UK), English (US) or English (intl)).

When adding an item ensure it is placed into the correct subsection. If the section does not exist, feel free to create one. Note that the title of a subsection should follow the following capitalization-style: "This is a subsection title".

Program names should be placed in heading-level 3. Following the capitalisation rules of the name of the application, e.g. GitHub, iMovie, etc. When unsure or unclear, which is almost never the case though, make use of the default capitalisation style of a sentence "Like this".

If there exists a **common** abbreviation for said application, feel free to add it to the heading-level 3 title within the previously mentioned subsection by placing it in parenthesis behind the full application name, e.g. Virtual Studio Code (VS Code). Do not add the abbreviation to any direct download links, use the fullname here.

For each direct download link for the application create a 'bullet point' to form an unordered list. When naming the link, please state the following:
`Full application name> <Branch (optional)> <Operating system> <32/64-bit if relevant> <Language>`

## Editing

An item may be edited when the information stated in the list is out-dated, or a link is incorrect and no longer working.

## Removing

An item may be removed from the list when the application is no longer being maintained. Please be sure to remove the entire item and its location in the Table of Contents section.

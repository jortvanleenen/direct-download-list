# Direct Download List
## About
A curated list of direct download links to the latest version of popular applications for the most common operating systems. It helps you save time and effort by no longer requiring you to go through an entire website just to click on a single download link like you might have done a millions time before in the past. This list only contains official download locations that are either linked from or can be found on the developer's own website.
